# Fitness effects of nucleotide and amino acid mutations updated with novel estimates of neutral rates.

## Overview
This repository computes an updated estimate of the fitness effects of mutations of SARS-CoV-2 genome, expanding and building on the approach presented in a [paper](https://academic.oup.com/ve/article/9/2/vead055/7265011) by [Jesse Bloom](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S12x_eQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Richard Neher](https://neherlab.org/).
